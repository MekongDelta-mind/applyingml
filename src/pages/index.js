        Applying machine learning is hard. There's a gap between <b>knowing</b>{" "}
        machine learning vs <b>applying</b> it at work to drive impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        Such knowledge is seldom documentedâ€”it's not something you can find in
        a textbook, classes, or how-to article. To fill this gap, this site shares 
        about the process of applying ML through guides and case studies, as well 
        as interviews experienced with ML practitioners.
